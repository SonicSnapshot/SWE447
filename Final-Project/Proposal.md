My final project will be to create a simple game about finding cubes underwater.   I'll include a controllable player character that will be a model I find and randomly spawning cubes at the bottom of the ocean.  The player will go up to the cubes and press a button to attach a balloon (a sphere) to the cube so that it floats up above the water. As a stretch goal, I'll render some bubbles into the water.

Week 1: Collect information on rendering things in and out of view and find a model for the player character (maybe like a submarine).

Week 2: Complete the necessary code to render the cone, and work on using inputs to move the cone. Using a matrix stack I might have to make a large cube under the player character that acts as the bottom of the ocean.

Week 3: Render a cube close to the player so they can interact with it. Figure out how to include distance based interaction.

Week 4: Implement the spheres and the rising motion of both the sphere and the cube upon player interaction.

Week 5: (Stretch goal) Add some bubbles to the water by randomly positioning various shades of gray/white points on a blue sphere larger than the player cone.

I will probably just make this a web based application using THREE.js
